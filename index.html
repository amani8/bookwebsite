    <p class="article-text"> While random text is mostly intended to just fill up the blank spaces, for many practical purposes you essentially want the look and feel of the dummy text you are going to use to be as close as possible to the real content that will eventually replace it. Considering that different language, writing style and substance of text result in an endless variety of different word combinations and visual impressions that a piece of text can have and make, it is always a plus to have it use the right kind of words and look like the final product as much as possible. Whether you are working in the technical, lifestyle, news or fantasy business, you will always impress and fascinate by having your concept pieces look and feel like they are the real technical, lifestyle, news or fantasy deal... to name but a few examples. </p>

    <p class="article-text"> You might be surprised how much mood or athmosphere even a totally random text can carry, while a fairly random text does this better ofcourse ;-). Granted, when you really get down to reading it, there won't be much meaningful coherence in any of it, but... regardless of the fact that random text makes no real sense, it does automatically get your mind working. Your brain will in fact try hard to understand it anyway, because out of habit it assumes that words in a text should mean something, or at least anything but nothing! You see, the brain launches itself into ‘I-must-understand-this’ mode when confronted with random text, trying every possible way in which it could still extract some sensible meaning from those random words, much like trying to solve a puzzle. Just try it. Reading random text for a few minutes, word for word, is very tiring. On the upside, reading a little bit, or just skimming over a random text like most people will do, makes your mind strongly touch upon a certain global idea of “subject matter” without its focus getting diverted by any actual meaningful details, while what the random text does do is automatically fill the readers mind with questions at the same time. The more your strongly your source text is written on a specific subject and uses a specific group of words, the stronger this effect will be. And this is exactly what you want your Fairly Random text to accomplish: it is there to provide a general mood, to hook interest and to look like the real thing. </p>
    <p class="article-text"> The Fairly Random text generator generates realistic seeming random text from any given source text. To do this it analyzes a source text that you provide. It measures overall word length and frequency, and lets you review the individual words of the original text. It also immediately creates a random text based on your source text. If you want, you can then use the various options to tell the text generator which of the words to use (or not to use) and what the resulting text should look like (in terms of sentences, paragraphs, headers et cetera). </p>
